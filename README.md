## About this jekyll theme

I came across this theme online and decided to put it in practice by porting it into jekyll. This is github page compatible, meaning you can just fork it to github pages and edit online, without the need of a local gem build.

You can use this theme in whatever ways you like as long as you comply with the original terms set up by HTML5 Up.

## Introduction from original theme maker

This is Phantom, a simple design built around a grid of large, colorful, semi-interactive
image tiles (of which you can have as many or as few as you like). Makes use of some
SVG and animation techniques I've been experimenting with on that other project of mine
you may have heard about (https://carrd.co), and includes a handy generic page for whatever.

you can use for pretty much whatever.
